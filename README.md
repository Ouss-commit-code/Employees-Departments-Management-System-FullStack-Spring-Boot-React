## 🚀 Welcome to the project I poured my heart (and many late-night coffees) into!

This is a **complete, production-ready Employee & Department Management System** built with the modern full-stack stack that enterprises need:  
**Spring Boot 3 + React 18 + MySQL 8** – clean architecture, secure, testable, and beautiful.
